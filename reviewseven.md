## Summary

Retro games are numerous because, as years go by, one generation of technology and creativity will inevitably replace the previous one. The example being used today is Donkey Kong Country 3. When Donkey Kong originally released as a game, it was a simple platformer that involved a character making their way to the top of an obstacle course to achieve a high score. When Donkey Kong Country came out, the brand was introduced to side-scrolling story-based platforming. Donkey Kong Country 3 built on this base and brought characters, Dixie Kong back to the screen along with newcomer Kiddy Kong.

Dixie and Kiddy Kong are charged with finding Donkey and Diddy Kong after they mysteriously go missing, and, as a result, the Kremlings have made taken over various parts of the Kongs' homeland. Players are tasked with navigating different side-scrolling levels that can go on land, underground, in the trees, and under the water. Along the way, players will need to bash and dodge enemies that aim to take out the player and expend their multiple lives to zero. The life system in the game has the traditional life count, but the life count will be depeleted if both Dixie and Kiddy Kong take damage on the field. The game starts with just Dixie at the beginning and Kiddy later; with both Kongs in tow, the player can begin the first level with both of them. Having both Kongs allows for the player to reach heights and discover secret; however, the level's goal can be completed with just one Kong. The flag system in the game allows the player to keep track of the level's completion status depending on what kind of flags are raised.

Each individual section of the island has a couple of levels, a few secrets that can be assessed through the NPCs that reside on the island, and a boss level waiting at the end. Sections are unlocked by clearing the sections that can already be accessed and obtaining items that can upgrade your transportation methods to reach new heights. Along the way, the player can participate in certain challenges that are scattered all over the island which can award the player bragging rights, completion status, and a few goodies that can add to your life count. Nintendo and Rare have outdone themselves with their quirky combination of lovable yet wacky characters along with their many hidden secrets in their games. Everytime a game comes out from this duo of developers, there is more than meets the eye of the basic goal of the game, and Donkey Kong Country 3 is no different from this formula. The game has a goal, a story, memorable and off-the-wall characters, secrets, and challenges that are sure to keep young and old players always craving more.

## Final Thoughts

Donkey Kong Country 3 was one of the very first console games I played as a kid. Originally, I played it when the game was ported to Gameboy Advance. To have the game return for Nintendo's Virtual Console collection allowed me to experience heavy amounts of nostalgia. Nintendo and Rare have brought life to many characters from Banjo and Kazooie to Donkey Kong and Diddie Kong. What made their games so amazing was the secrets; without RARE's creativity, I would not have known that games could be more than their primary objectives. Donkey Kong Country 3 could be played like a speedrun or just as an exploration game all wrapped up into a fun little package of challenges. The only thing that I had frustration with was the areas that could only be accessed with both Kongs. One could complete the level, but you could potentially get stuck or start the level all over again by making a near-fatal mistake that left you with just one Kong but no backup strategy except suicide. The game still made an amazing experience to make up for one small frustration. The game challenged the experienced player while allowing for the casual player to just make their way through the game; truly, this game was perfect for its era.
