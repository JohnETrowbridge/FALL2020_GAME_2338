## Summary

Unparallel is a top-down puzzle game where the player's goal is to reach the end of a laboratory maze. The player will assume the role of a white rat who appears to be trapped in some kind of run-down experimental maze with nothing but a black bottomless abyss, a few platforms, and some ominous synth background music. The maze is divided into sections that have puzzles which must be solved in order to progress through the maze. While you do not know the very depth of the maze, the game has no save feature; be prepared to the complete the game in its entirety in one sitting.

The game is crafted in Unity as a pixel-based game that utilies sprites to create the environment and the characters. The player can move the white rat up, down, left, and right through the maze. While there is a black area to signify the edge of the platforms, the player can not run the rat right off the edge of the platform. There are also no checkpoints for the character to save, but there are checkpoints that signify the end of the maze's sections. Right before the puzzles begin, the player will notice that there is a mirror that seems to reveal hidden passages in the black abyss that are invisible to the player without the use of the mirror.

As you progress, the game will eventually reveal that there are gates that must be opened through the use of switches that can only be activated by electronic boxes to bring power to the gates. Using the spacebar, the player is able to push and pull the boxes with the character right next to them in a vertical or horizontal orientation. These orientations will prove to tricky at times because some passages are so narrow that they have to be approached with one orientation over the other to avoid the character from being hindered from moving. As each puzzle is solved, the music also ramps up and changes respectively. This music is made to immerse you in the ominous world of Unparallel if the user chooses to play with headphones. Fear not, for, though the darkness surrounds you, there is a way out.

## Final Thoughts

The game was very well-designed from an artistic and musical standpoint. I was already feeling the world through the perspective of the mouse when playing and listening, especially since I used headphones. The puzzles were challenging at times because boxes could only move in certain places without me having to move them back and rethink my strategy. The game can be played in one sitting which took me about 15 minutes, but, eventually, the same mechanic for the puzzles was starting to get tedious. Obviously, the game was made to just be enjoyed for how simple and artistic that it was, but I was hoping that maybe some kind of color-coded box and switch could've been utilized as a puzzle. Don't get me wrong, but a game needs to have more diversity in interaction despite having a good story or artistic background.
