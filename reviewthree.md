On a scale from 1 to 10, I would give this game an 7 out of 10 rating.

## Summary

Deltarune is a 2D action strategy RPG that is developed by Toby Fox, who created the popular game, UNDERTALE.
The player assumes the role of Kris, a young human from a very fantasical place that is not named but is inhabited by monsters. Kris is taken to school and
partnered with the class bully, Susie; after being assigned to go retrieve chalk from the darkened school closet, 
Kris and Susie seemingly fall through the closet floor into a world known as the Dark World. 
In the Dark World, Kris and Susie partner up with a prince known as Ralsei in order to close the fountain of darkness that appeared in a rival kingdom 
and to send Kris and Susie back home.

The game prides itself on quirky characters with hilarious dialogue and fast-paced strategy battles. 
However, the battles are not your typical fight to kill battles. 
In Deltarune, the mechanic of the game is that you can either fight to kill the enemies
or find a way to connect with them through different actions to minimize their killing intent or endurance.
By minimizing their killing intent or endurance, the player can choose to spare the monsters from their cruel fate of defeat by the player.
Unlike it's predecessor, UNDERTALE, Deltarune doesn't have an exact reward for sparing enemies except some dialogue, but the whole idea behind the story of Deltarune seems to be that your choices don't matter and, as a result, don't change the future.

When a player encounters an enemy by being detected and touched by the enemy, the player and party are taken to a seperate battle scene where you will choose to either fight, act, or spare. By fighting, the player will inflict damage on the enemy. By acting, the player can perform various actions determined by the developer and what kind of monster the player is up against. By sparing, you will spare the monster from dying in the heat of battle, but you have to minimize their killing intent or endurance through the mechanic of acting. When the player turn ends, your soul comes to the middle of the battleground in the form of a heart. When the heart appears, enemy bullet patterns will appear to attack the heart, and the objective is to move the heart out of the way of the bullet attacks. Each monster has its own attack pattern depending on what kind of monster or story character that it is. Deltarune, like its predecessor, breathes a breath of fresh air into the typical RPG setup because, unless it is tied to the story in some way, not many games incorporate the player sparing the enemy during the battle phase.

## Final Thoughts

As an avid RPG player, Deltarune is a welcome surprise when it comes to story and gameplay mechanics. I've been privileged to know and experience the game's predecessor, UNDERTALE. While the game contains the same charm with a few more add-ons, I still have some problems with the game's release. Some indie story games today have adopted this idea of a chapter-based game in order for the developer to release content little by little. The problem with this idea is that it develops a sense of false hype when there is no guarantee that the developer will be able to deliver the content fast enough, if at all, before the players lose interest. Aside from the release form, the game does tend to get repetitive with the same bullet patterns over and over again due to a lack of content for the first chapter. The game does make up for this weakness with secrets and lore that help shape the world that the game is crafted in, and, as a fan of Toby Fox's work, the secrets and lore cover gameplay and overall story appeal as a way of maintaining the player's attention despite the game's repetitive nature.
