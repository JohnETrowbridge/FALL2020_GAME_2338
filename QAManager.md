Your QA Manager comes to you and explains that users are getting stuck on
a password reset field screen because error messages are not displaying
with password criteria information. What type of testing would have
caught this? Describe and explain your answer.

Your Answer:
For this test, if the developer has a QA Manager, the test is to be conducted in an internal case environment; as a result, White Box Testing will currently be in effect. The test that has failed to be completed is a Negative Test. The Negative Test's role is to evaluate if the program is adequately informing the user that an error occurred in the program due to incorrect usage of the program. An example for incorrect usage of a program could be incorrectly entering unacceptable characters into a password field; another example for incorrect usage of a program could be pressing a button to continue without having fulfilled the requirements to continue. If tested correctly, the program would issue a message of some kind to the user in order for a change in usage to hopefully occur.
