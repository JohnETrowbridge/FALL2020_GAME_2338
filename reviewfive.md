## Summary

Imagine yourself as an astronaut on a fictional ship set out to complete a mission at a fictional station. What's not so fictional is that there is an imposter among your crewmates that is attempting to kill every last one of the team. If survive to the end, it's a job well done for your team, but, if you are dead, the mission is just as lost in space as the corpses of your team. The caveat to this fate is if the crewmates can figure out who the imposter is and vote him out in this world of astronomical mayhem.

There are two primary objectives to being a part of this mission. The first objective is being a crewmate. As a crewmate, you must complete all the tasks that are assigned to you by an automated computer, but you must complete these tasks quickly. Among the crew is an imposter that seeks to sabotage the station in an attempt to end the lives of all the crew. If a dead body appears, the crewmates can report it and talk amongst themselves about who the imposter might be. The game continues this exact cycle until the imposter is voted out of the station or outnumbers the remaining number of crewmates. In contrast, the second obejective is being an imposter. As an imposter, their role is to kill every player by any means necessary, but they can't be caught. If the imposter is caught, crewmates have the ability to vote them out of the ship which results in a loss for the imposter.

The game has a unique feature in which the host of the game server can decide how the game is played for one or many rounds. The game can become intense very quickly if visual tasks can't be seen, players run too fast, or visibility is limited. The choice of gameplay is what makes every round of the game unique and challenging. For many players, this game can be casual and funny, and for other players, this game can become a one way ticket to the abyss where serious tactics and frustation abound. All in all, the quirky bean-shaped characters of Among Us help carry on a trend for social games with simplistic design and engaging gameplay.

## Final Thoughts

Among Us is a game that definitely makes somebody want to crave more. I personally didn't even know about the game until I happen to just watch a stream of somebody playing it. The game is so simple that it gives me hope that even simple design with an engaging and shaky commnuity of gameplay can still have players engaged. The game supports a casual and a hardcore style of gameplay which makes me excited because no two rounds will ever be the same. Smart and dumb players are numerous on the servers, but it helps make the social environment change. On some games, this chaos and confusion is an advantage for an imposter to fool other players while silently killing the others.
