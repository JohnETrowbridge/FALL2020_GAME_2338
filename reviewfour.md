## Summary

Cuphead is a 2D side-scrolling platformer that takes place in a world inspired by the cartoons of the 1930s. Cuphead and Mugman, two young cups underneath Elder Kettle, suddenly wander into Hell and gambled with the Devil. As expected, the two cups lost and are about to lose their souls as a result. The caveat to this loss is that the two cups work with the devil to defeat other characters and collect their soul contracts. If the cups refuse, their souls will be taken anyway.

From running, gunning, and dodging, the game reignites these familiar
concepts that many utilized as kids. To make the game harder, the characters are not your typical bosses with simple attack patterns. These bosses can throw literal punches, spit seeds, and fire bullets in numerous waves. While it may seem simple at first, the game doesn't tell you what the attack patterns are, and, to make matters worse, the bosses have transformation phases that completely shake up their attack patterns. The player will have to be fast and tactical in order to outsmart the bosses before the cups become shattered and soulless.

The game has several platforming levels and bosses that are divided up into acts. These acts cannot be traversed until all the soul contracts are collected on that specific part of the world. The platforming levels' primary purpose is to help the player obtain coins to purchase different power-ups such as invincibility and smoke dodge and power-ups and bullet patterns such as boomerang and shot-put attacks. After the boss level is completed, the player is given a grade depending on how well they performed. While performance doesn't make a huge difference to the game, it does give the player achievements and bragging rights. The game is essentially crafted to be extremely hard, and these bragging rights show just how well gamers can be in a world that is made with simple mechanics but crazy twists.

## Final Thoughts

I personally enjoyed Cuphead as a challenge. The game has made me rage more times than one because of how close I was to completing the specific boss. While this is a small detail, it is the one reason that I gave this game one level below ten. I love a game that has a challenge and a clear objective with how to meet that challenge, but, with no prior warning of what I am going up against, the game just made a big gap where trial and error exists. The game still presented a very beautiful landscape, crazy twists, loveable yet feisty characters, and a good spoonful of nostalgia. Whether you are a hardcore or casual gamer, I think everyone should give Cuphead a try just to gauge how well of a gamer that they actually are.
