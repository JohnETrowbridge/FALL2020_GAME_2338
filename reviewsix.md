## Summary

Ever wanted titans, monsters, cars, and modern luxury all mixed together into an epic fantasy adventure? Look no further than Final Fantasy XV. The game has the player taking the role of Noctis along with giving commands to his band of merry men. These men are on a mission to secure the throne for the kingdom from a shadow organization that seeks to take the throne from the current king. Along the way, the player will be able to openly explore the world and complete side quests to level up, but beware of the bosses that wander the land, skies, and seas.

The game begins with a tutorial that teaches the player how to fight. Aside from the basic controls to move, attack, and defend, the player can throw their weapon at an enemy or ledge in order to warp to that point. While the player can freely do this action at any time, there is a limit to how many times it can be used. Final Fantasy XV utilizes an endurance counter that determines how many times the player can use special physical moves alongside the typical Health system and Power system. These tactics change the game in the way that the player can now strategize where they can end up on the field during battle. If the player is above the enemy during a warp, they can recover for a bit from battle until the endurance runs out, or the player can attack from above for an extra boost in attack. These hunts can get dangerous since the enemies being taken on may hunt in groups rather than just one huge beast.

All around the map, there are several side quests that lead to these hunting grounds. The experience gained from enemies are important, but the experience for the characters is gained primarily through completing these side quests. After completing the side quests, the player can find a place to rest in order to have the characters level up from the number of points obtained before the rest. You can travel around the map to these points by walking or by driving in the car known as the Regalia. The car can be driven by the player or have Ignis drive it to the destination that the player marks on the map. The drive-by allows the game to give the player a sense of anxiety and patience as they slowly approach their destination whether it be safe or dangerous; even enemies can stop the car in the middle of the road in order to attack. The game keeps the player on their toes at all times as the race for the throne becomes red hot.

## Final Thoughts

I feel blessed that I was able to experience Final Fantasy XV. I don't own a PS4, but I do own a PC. The PC becomes hot with this game, but it is surprisingly well-detailed either way. The world captivates you in a way that just blows your mind and opens your eyes. The battles can get your heart pounding because depending on how prepared you are and how smart you are can shift the battle. If you don't utilize the vast array of weapons and the warp point technique, the enemy or enemies can begin to land several blows that can knock you for a loop or take several of your allies down, even if you are strong enough. I look forward to the car drive, even though it is long, because it gives me nostalgia. Whenever I would go places with my family and was feeling a little anxious for some reason, I learned to enjoy the ride due to the time it gave me to get my thoughts and emotions together. The game is insanely long and the number of side quests can be annoying at times, but the story and the world's design make up for this slight bore in experience and repetition for the game.
