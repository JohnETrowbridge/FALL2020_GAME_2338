## Summary

Backbone is a noir roleplaying detective game where you assume the role of a raccoon known as Howard Lotor in the dystopian city of Vancouver, BC. The city is inhabited by animals of different species and breeds and is not devoid of the idea of law and crime. The player navigates Howard Lotor through the city in order to uncover the city's secrets and take on a case or two. These cases will get dark very fast, but nothing can stop your ace detective skills from matching the challenge. The road will be tough, edgy, rainy, and slightly nostalgic, but a true detective doesn't know when to quit.

The game is crafted in Unreal Engine as a pixel-based game that utilizes sprites to add depth to the game using foreground, background, and middle-ground. Players can move the character back and forth slowly, run, and crouch through the environments. Howard can engage in conversation with a few of the inhabitants using a list of pre-written responses made by the developers. While for some players it would be easy to quickly run through the responses to end the conversation, the choices do give different outcomes on the information that you can obtain which may help you complete an objective or two to further the main story. Some of these conversations and responses contain vulgar language and reference to drugs, but, if you don't mind those things, it shouldn't halt your enjoyment of the game. Although, there are a few pieces of dialogue that can become confusing after a while.

As you progress in the game, you will players will eventually be tasked to sneak into buildings and rooms without being caught by characters that are programmed to survey the area in which you reside. If you are caught, you will be taken to a game over screen and respawned at the last point the game saved. There is a moment where you may have to think outside the box in order to pass an objective because it is not mentioned how to pass it. Aside from the sneaking and entering, investigating, and discovering, there are moments that may be too much for young players to handle such as dead bodies, scary environments, touchy dialogue and a slight bit of vomit. Everything is pixelated in this world; perhaps, you could think of these vulgar moments as just another form of censoring.

## Final Thoughts

Backbone is an amazing achievement in it of itself because of the fact that the game utilizes Unreal Engine. Unreal Engine was primarily made to create 3D worlds and objects, not 2D. The developers utilized pixel art and made them into objects in the world while the camera does all the work in confining the player to view the world the way it was meant to be viewed. Aside from the artwork, the music played a very good role in immersing the player into the dystopian city, the dialogue, and the suspense-filled investigation. While there is plenty of dialogue to fill the story than straight action, I am hoping that, in future chapters, the developers will add more investigative and bone-chilling moments to liven up the game. The dialogue became too much after a while because there were so many characters, responses, and lore to process all at once. While trying to figure out how to talk with these characters effectively, I ended up overloading my brain with so much information that I forgot why I was even there. Overall, Backbone has plenty of charm to grab the attention of the player even if it is just a prologue for now.
