## Summary

	  Art Fight Duel is a strategy fighting game where the user plans and executes characters and actions on a board, through the use of cards, against a computer-generated team utilizing the same characters that you have available. Controlled by an overall game clock, the enemy team spawns in waves and must be defeated before continuing onto the next wave. Waves are defeated by spawning characters of your own and depleting the health points of the enemies. The game can also be extended through the use of action cards the specifically extend the game time. The objective is to gain a high score by defeating as many waves as possible before the game clock reaches zero.

	  The user is set in a world where there are two sides, sugar and spice; artists contributing to this interactive world have designed characters and made them into cards. These cards bring characters from both sides and put them on a specifically designed arena to fight to the death. These cards can range from attackers, healers, a mix of the two, and game actions. These cards randomly generate themselves into the user's hand every few seconds. The user and computer have four spaces to spawn characters, and the user can spawn action cards freely, if on hand.

	  When the game begins, the game clock starts at 2 minutes and begins to count down. Users start with eight cards ranging from characters to action cards. On each card, there is a name for the card and a description of what the card does on the field. Whether the user chooses to play or not is completely up to them, but the game clock will continue to count down no matter what is done on the field. Obtaining a higher score is achieved by defeating the characters and completing waves one after the other for as long as the user can manage to keep the clock from reaching zero. Among the cards given, there are cards to increase the game clock's time by half a minute or a tenth of a minute. Once the game's clock reaches zero, the game is declared to be over, and the high score is displayed and recorded for the user. You can even choose to save your data and export it as a file to be imported later.

## Final Thoughts

    The game was very well designed for something that seemed to be developed as a small project. The strategy was very fast-paced but fun since there were so many quirky characters and definitive actions that could be carried out. As a player, there was sometimes no need to even read the descriptions on the cards just to have a good time. Still, it was very hard to read the cards and their descriptions with such a small type, and that was part of the reason why it didn't matter to even read them. Even after obtaining the cards in an overall collection that could be read later, the type was still too small for me to read. Aside from the game's attractive art style and strategic game mechanics, the type was the only element keeping me from completely enjoying the game because I love to actually strategize in a strategy game. Due to this game's attractive nature, I would've loved to see a whole lot more characters or actions to make this game take sudden twists. Hopefully, this game will see more updates and contributions in the future.
